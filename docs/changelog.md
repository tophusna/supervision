### 0.9.0 <small>June 7, 2023</small>

- Added [[#118](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/118)]: ability to select [`sv.Detections`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/detection/core/#supervision.detection.core.Detections.__getitem__) by index, list of indexes or slice. Here is an example illustrating the new selection methods.

```python
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> detections = sv.Detections(...)
>>> len(detections[0])
1
>>> len(detections[[0, 1]])
2
>>> len(detections[0:2])
2
```

- Added [[#101](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/101)]: ability to extract masks from YOLOv8 result using [`sv.Detections.from_yolov8`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/detection/core/#supervision.detection.core.Detections.from_yolov8). Here is an example illustrating how to extract boolean masks from the result of the YOLOv8 model inference.

```python
>>> import cv2
>>> from ultralytics import YOLO
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> image = cv2.imread(...)
>>> image.shape
(640, 640, 3)

>>> model = YOLO('yolov8s-seg.pt')
>>> result = model(image)[0]
>>> detections = sv.Detections.from_yolov8(result)
>>> detections.mask.shape
(2, 640, 640)
```

- Added [[#122](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/122)]: ability to crop image using [`sv.crop`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/utils/image/#crop). Here is an example showing how to get a separate crop for each detection in `sv.Detections`.

```python
>>> import cv2
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> image = cv2.imread(...)
>>> detections = sv.Detections(...)
>>> len(detections)
2
>>> crops = [
...     sv.crop(image=image, xyxy=xyxy) 
...     for xyxy 
...     in detections.xyxy
... ]
>>> len(crops)
2
```

- Added [[#120](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/120)]: ability to conveniently save multiple images into directory using [`sv.ImageSink`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/utils/image/#imagesink). Here is an example showing how to save every tenth video frame as a separate image.

```python
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> with sv.ImageSink(target_dir_path='target/directory/path') as sink:
...     for image in sv.get_video_frames_generator(source_path='source_video.mp4', stride=10):
...         sink.save_image(image=image)
```

- Fixed [[#106](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/issues/106)]: inconvenient handling of [`sv.PolygonZone`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/detection/tools/polygon_zone/#polygonzone) coordinates. Now `sv.PolygonZone` accepts coordinates in the form of `[[x1, y1], [x2, y2], ...]` that can be both integers and floats.

### 0.8.0 <small>May 17, 2023</small>

- Added [[#100](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/100)]: support for dataset inheritance. The current `Dataset` got renamed to `DetectionDataset`. Now [`DetectionDataset`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/dataset/core/#detectiondataset) inherits from `BaseDataset`. This change was made to enforce the future consistency of APIs of different types of computer vision datasets.
- Added [[#100](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/100)]: ability to save datasets in YOLO format using [`DetectionDataset.as_yolo`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/dataset/core/#supervision.dataset.core.DetectionDataset.as_yolo). 

```python
>>> import roboflow
>>> from roboflow import Roboflow
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> roboflow.login()

>>> rf = Roboflow()

>>> project = rf.workspace(WORKSPACE_ID).project(PROJECT_ID)
>>> dataset = project.version(PROJECT_VERSION).download("yolov5")

>>> ds = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
...     images_directory_path=f"{dataset.location}/train/images",
...     annotations_directory_path=f"{dataset.location}/train/labels",
...     data_yaml_path=f"{dataset.location}/data.yaml"
... )

>>> ds.classes
['dog', 'person']
```

- Added [[#102](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/103)]: support for [`DetectionDataset.split`](https://roboflow.github.io/supervision/dataset/core/#supervision.dataset.core.DetectionDataset.split) allowing to divide `DetectionDataset` into two parts. 

```python
>>> import supervision as sv

>>> ds = sv.DetectionDataset(...)
>>> train_ds, test_ds = ds.split(split_ratio=0.7, random_state=42, shuffle=True)

>>> len(train_ds), len(test_ds)
(700, 300)
```

- Changed [[#100](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/100)]: default value of `approximation_percentage` parameter from `0.75` to `0.0` in `DetectionDataset.as_yolo` and `DetectionDataset.as_pascal_voc`.
