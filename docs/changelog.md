### 0.12.0 <small>July 24, 2023</small>

- Added ability to calculate confusion matrices for model predictions using the `ConfusionMatrix` API. You can plot matrices with the ConfusionMatrix `plot()` class method.

```python
>>> import supervision as sv
>>> from ultralytics import YOLO

>>> model = YOLO('yolov8s.pt')

>>> dataset = sv.DetectionDataset.from_yolo(
...     images_directory_path='...',
...     annotations_directory_path='...',
...     data_yaml_path='...'
... )

>>> predictions, target = [], []

>>> for _, image, labels in dataset:
...    result = model(image)[0]
...    detections = sv.Detections.from_yolov8(result)
...    predictions.append(detections)
...    target.append(labels)

>>> matrix = ConfusionMatrix.from_detections(
...     predictions=predictions,
...     target=target,
...     classes=dataset.classes
... )
>>> matrix.plot('...')
```

- Added the `from_mmdetection()` class method on `sv.Detections` for loading MMDetections data.

```python
>>> import cv2
>>> import supervision as sv
>>> from mmdet.apis import DetInferencer
>>> inferencer = DetInferencer(model_name, checkpoint, device)

>>> mmdet_result = inferencer(SOURCE_IMAGE_PATH, out_dir='./output', return_datasample=True)["predictions"][0]
>>> detections = sv.Detections.from_mmdet(mmdet_result)
```

- Users can install `supervision` using both the headless version of opencv (with `pip install supervision`) and the full version of opencv (with `pip install supervision[full]`).

- Fixed [#188](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/issues/188): COCO datasets cannot be loaded when there are images without annotations
- Fixed issue in [#150](https://github.com/roboflow/supervision/pull/150): COCO class ID loading `image_id` and `labels_id` should start from 0 instead of 1
- `supervision` no longer officially supports Python 3.7 (#179).
