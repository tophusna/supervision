## How To: Track Objects
This is a tutorial to track object in a video using [ByteTrack](https://supervision.roboflow.com/trackers/#supervision.tracker.byte_tracker.core.ByteTrack).
### What is Tracking?
Tracking is an essential application of computer vision, which is used in mainly in videos or set of images which contain a sequence of events(the set of images could be simply frames of a video). It takes an initial set of detections from a video as per the requirement of the project, provides some unique identification to the detections and tracks as the position changes with time in a video. Supervision provides some powerful tools to track object in videos. This tutorial would cover how to make detections in a video, track those detections and then label them for unique identification using Supervision. Further, it would also cover how to trace the path covered by the detections.
### Step 1:Building a detection pipeline for videos
### Step 2:Tracking the detections
### Step 3:Labels the detections being tracked
### Step 4:Tracing the path of the detections
### Conclusion and further ideas
